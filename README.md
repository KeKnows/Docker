# Assignment #5 - Dockerize a Recipe Sharing Application

A full-stack recipe sharing application with React frontend and Node.js backend.

## Your Assignment
Your task is to containerize this application using Docker and Docker Compose. You'll need to create:
1. `frontend/Dockerfile` - To containerize the React app
2. `backend/Dockerfile` - To containerize the Node.js API
3. `docker-compose.yml` - To orchestrate both services

Once completed, users should be able to run the entire application with a single command: `docker-compose up`.

Good luck! ðŸš€

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm

### Running the Application Locally

1. **Start the Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
Backend will run on `http://localhost:8080`. You can preview all recipes at `http://localhost:8080/api/recipes`.

2. **Start the Frontend (in a new terminal)**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port).

3. **Test the Application**:
    - Visit the URL shown in your terminal (Usually `http://localhost:3000`)
    - You should see sample recipes loaded
    - Try adding a new recipe using the form
    - Refresh the page to verify data persistence
    - You can also see that it has been added in the backed by visiting or refreshing `http://localhost:8080/api/recipes`

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/recipes` - Get all recipes
- `GET /api/recipes/:id` - Get single recipe
- `POST /api/recipes` - Create new recipe
- `DELETE /api/recipes/:id` - Delete recipe
- `GET /api/health` - Health check

## Project Structure
```bash
recipe-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/       # React application (Vite)
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/        # Node.js/Express API
â””â”€â”€ README.md       # This file

'''Deploying the Recipe Sharing application to Google Cloud Run highlighted several differences from local Docker Compose development. Locally, containers are persistent and easy to connect on predictable ports; in Cloud Run, instances are ephemeral and scale automatically, so I had to ensure the backend relied on environment variables (particularly PORT) and did not assume local filesystem persistence. Cloud Runâ€™s serverless container model abstracts away instance provisioning and autoscaling, letting me focus on container images and service configuration rather than VM orchestration. The build/deploy pipeline using Cloud Build (with cloudbuild-*.yaml) also enforced a more reproducible, Git-driven workflow than my local dev cycle; builds are executed in Googleâ€™s environment and images are pushed to Container Registry. The main advantages I see for real-world apps are autoscaling, pay-for-what-you-use cost efficiency, and production-ready logging/monitoring integrations. The primary tradeoffs are the need to externalize state (databases, object storage) and being careful with cold starts and request timeouts; overall, Cloud Run greatly simplifies deployment while encouraging cloud-friendly design patterns.'''
